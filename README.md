## Description

This script is a dictionary API which returns the word searched by the user and its corresponding definition. It has a
large database included to ensure that most common words are able to be searched. When the script is run, the user is
directed to the browser where they can see the documentation for this API.

### Dependencies

This project uses two third party libraries to build this API.

#### pandas

The pandas library is used to read and extract the relevant information from the dataset, which is saved in a .csv file.
This file is included in the root directory.

#### flash

The flask library is used to build the client side interface, which allows users to read the documentation, and search
for their desired word in the URL.

## Future Directions

Version 2 of this project will include a web app where users can search the word they would like to learn the definition
for, in a form, rather than just the URL endpoint.
